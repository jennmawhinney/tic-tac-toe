# Project 0

Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O. The aim of the game is to get 3 in a row. The winner will receive a prize.

The Scoreboard keeps track of how many games are won by each side and the ultimate winner will be declared after 3 wins.

A draw will be declared if no one wins.

Play the game [here.](http://jennmawhinney.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

Features that I'd like to add in the future:
<ul>
<li>customisable tokens.</li>
<li>music for the winner.</li>
<li>generate a random play so that the  players could be either X or O.</li>
</ul>
