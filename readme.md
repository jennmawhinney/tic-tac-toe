# Project 0

Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O. The aim of the game is to get 3 in a row. The winner will receive a prize.

The Scoreboard keeps track of how many games are won by each side and the ultimate winner will be declared after 3 wins.

A draw will be declared if no one wins.

Features that I'd like to add in the future:
*customisable tokens
*music for the winner
